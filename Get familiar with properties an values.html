    <h1>The ghost of The Stanley Hotel</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(129, 178, 233)">
      The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, has been around for more than
      100 years and was built as a posh getaway for the wealthy seeking solitude
      in the mountains. As the years passed, however, occupancy declined, and by
      the 1970s, the grand hotel had fallen into disrepair. It was around that
      time that famed author Stephen King spent the night there and was inspired
      to write the book “The Shining.” The book and blockbuster film helped
      return the Stanley to its former glory. Now, guests come in droves to see
      the hotel that inspired one of the scariest horror movies of all time.
      Given its history, it should come as no surprise that many visitors report
      strange happenings. Aware of the ghostly rumors, Texas resident Henry Yau
      booked a last-minute getaway in April of 2016 to “check it out.” After
      arriving, Yau had dinner, then wandered around the Stanley to take photos.
      Stopping at the staircase, he waited for people to clear the area, then
      took a picture, thinking nothing of it. Later that night, however, Yau
      fell seriously ill. “I felt really sick, I had the shivers, I was like,
      something’s really wrong,” he tells TODAY.com. His companion suggested he
      go to the emergency room, but Yau refused. On the trip home, Yau began
      swiping through the photos he’d taken when he discovered what he said was
      a “really, really strange image” of someone standing on the stairs. Except
      no one had been there. The next day, he posted the photo on Instagram,
      half-joking that he’d captured a ghost — and the world took notice. Almost
      overnight, Yau found himself in the limelight with his ghost picture
      warranting attention from global media outlets and paranormal experts who
      wanted to examine the photo. “Some experts say that there’s two ghosts,
      and other people said that the reason I got sick is because the ghost was
      trying to materialize, taking energy out of me,” he said. “There’s so many
      theories about this.” And what does Yau think? “I have no idea,” he says
      with a laugh.
